 * The Instrumentation class is a low level class for instrumenting your app's code. It allows you
 * to listen to framework level profiling events, as well as creating and firing your own such
 * events.
 *
 * For example, if you wanted to instrument how long a particular action was taking:
 *
 *     import { Instrumentation, Action } from 'denali';
 *     export default class MyAction extends Action {
 *       respond() {
 *         let Post = this.modelFor('post');
 *         return Instrumentation.instrument('post lookup', { currentUser: this.user.id }, () => {
 *           Post.find({ user: this.user });
 *         });
 *       }
 *     }
